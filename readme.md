Purpose of website: The purpose of this website is to allow users to have a way to know when a Youtuber or a Twitch Streamer is streaming or uploading a video. 

##JS Code Cited:

### General

Rocco helped with the output code for the schedule as well as the schedule layout (HTML and CSS). The JS code was also used in the explore channels and account following list since the output is similar for them just different innerHTML output. 

### Header JS

## Dashboard code

Some of the eventlistener code for the "modelbox" (when you press on the schedule boxes and it displays a div with a black background and the stream/upload info) was inspired from this https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_modals.asp (to toggle on was more polished to work with more than one rectangle with the help from Rocco).


## Account Following List 
Janelle showed me another way to output the html contents in the JS code written (which I reviewed to further understand). I left it there so I can refer to it in the future should I need to use this method again
